# Welcome to the Scott Cohen Coding Exercise Extravaganza!

I am Scott, and I will be your Scott for this coding exercise.

## Task 1: Get this repo into some semblance of prod-ready shape

- Git init (creating a local Git repo for the project)
- Create .gitignore file for node_modules 
- Install Next.js (as we will need a modern React framework down the line)
- Install SASS for styles
- Install Jest for unit testings

TO DOS:

- Convert existing React app to Next.js

## Task 2: Get the data



## Task 3: Just kidding, there was no task 3

Thank you for considering me for this position!
