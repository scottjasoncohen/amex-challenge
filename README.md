# Scott Cohen Coding Challenge

Hello! I am Scott Cohen, and I will be your Scott Cohen this fine day.

## Task 1: Get this somewhat production-ready

- Initialize a new Git repo, create .gitignore
- Rename project in package.json
- Add SASS, Jest, ESBuild

TO-DO: Convert app to Next.js or other modern framework

## Task 2: Get this data served!

I'm writing a UseEffect hook in both of these data calls, but it's clear I'm getting it slightly wrong. On the appWithoutSSRData, it's loading, but not seemingly returning any data. And with appWithSSRData, I'm getting a null setting somewhere. Unfortunately, I ran out of time while doing this, so while this is not my best work, I hope you can see where I was headed with all this.
